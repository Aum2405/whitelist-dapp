# CryptoDevs NFT Collection

## Overview
**CryptoDevs** is a limited edition NFT collection built on the Ethereum blockchain.  
The project uses two smart contracts:
- `CryptoDevs.sol`: An ERC721 NFT contract with whitelist functionality.
- `Whitelist.sol`: A simple contract to manage and restrict the number of addresses eligible for whitelist minting.

This project is built using Solidity and OpenZeppelin smart contracts to ensure security and standard compliance.

---

## Features
- **Whitelist-based minting**:  
  Whitelisted users can mint a free NFT (one per address).
- **Public minting**:  
  Non-whitelisted users can mint by paying a fixed price (0.01 ETH).
- **Limited supply**:  
  A maximum of 20 NFTs can ever be minted.
- **Ownership privileges**:  
  Contract owner can withdraw all collected Ether from the smart contract.
- **Gas-efficient**:  
  Designed to protect reserved whitelist slots and optimize minting logic.

---

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Whitelist.sol
- Manages whitelisted addresses.
- Limits the number of whitelisted users based on a maximum cap set during deployment.
- Allows users to self-whitelist if slots are available.

### 2. CryptoDevs.sol
- ERC721 NFT smart contract (using OpenZeppelinâ€™s `ERC721Enumerable` and `Ownable`).
- Integrates with the deployed `Whitelist` contract to manage minting eligibility.
- Handles minting payments for public users.
- Provides a secure withdrawal function for the owner.

## Installation and Deployment

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Foundry**
   Foundry is a blazing fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.
   ```bash
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   foundryup
   ```

3. **Compile Contracts**
   ```bash
   forge build
   ```

4. **Deploy Whitelist Contract**
   Deploy the `Whitelist` contract first and note its deployed address.

5. **Deploy CryptoDevs Contract**
   Use the deployed `Whitelist` contract address in the constructor of `CryptoDevs`.
